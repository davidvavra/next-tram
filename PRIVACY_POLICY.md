Privacy policy
==============
This is a very simple app for knowing about next trams in Prague, Czech Republic around your location. It's open-source and non-profit. The app comes with no guarantees about functionality.

What information do I collect?
------------------------------
Location of the user is collected after permission request is granted. It's matched with unique anonymous id of the user.

How do I use that information?
------------------------------
I use user's location to show nearby trams. The location is saved on my server for convenience - otherwise there would be a permission request every time you use it.

What information do I share?
----------------------------
I share location of the user with data provider (CHAPS s.r.o). But the shared location is anonymous, it's not linked with the user in any way.
